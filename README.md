## 1. Introduction

3D Minesweeper is a three-dimensional adaptation of the classic Minesweeper game. In this version, players navigate through a three-dimensional grid to uncover tiles, avoid mines, and clear the entire field without detonating any bombs. The game is a test of your logic, spatial awareness, and problem-solving skills.

## 2. Game Objective

The objective of 3D Minesweeper is to uncover all non-mine tiles on the grid without triggering any mines. To achieve this, you must use logic to deduce the locations of mines based on the numerical hints revealed when you click on a tile. The game is won when all non-mine tiles are revealed, and it's lost if you accidentally uncover a mine.
