		Is it easy to play 3D Minesweeper? Yeah with this guide will you be walked through the rules and
		gameplay of 3D Minesweeper.
	</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Objective</h3>
	<p>
		The objective of 3D Minesweeper is to clear the playing area without detonating any mines. You
		win the game when all non-mine cells are revealed. Be careful, as one wrong move could lead to a
		devastating explosion!
	</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Gameplay</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>The Game Board</strong>
			<p>
				The game is played on a 3D grid, where each cell can either contain a mine or a number
				representing the number of adjacent mines.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Revealing Cells</strong>
			<p>
				To reveal a cell, simply click on it. If it's a mine, the game is over, and you'll have to
				start again. If the cell is not a mine, a number will be displayed. This number indicates
				the count of mines in the neighboring cells.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Using Clues</strong>
			<p>
				The numbers revealed on the board are crucial clues to help you avoid mines. Use these
				numbers to deduce the locations of mines and make strategic decisions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Flagging Mines</strong>
			<p>
				If you suspect a cell contains a mine, right-click on it to place a flag. This helps you
				remember the potential mine locations and prevents accidental clicks.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Adjacent Cells</strong>
			<p>
				If a cell has a "0" on it, it means there are no mines in its neighboring cells. When you
				reveal such a cell, it will automatically expand to reveal adjacent cells until numbered
				cells are reached.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Winning the Game</strong>
			<p>
				To win, reveal all non-mine cells on the grid. Once you've successfully cleared the board,
				celebrate your victory!
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>
			<p>
				The more you play, the better you'll get at recognizing patterns and making informed
				decisions. Don't get discouraged by initial losses; instead, use them as learning
				opportunities.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 class="h3">Tips for Success</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Start with Safe Cells</strong>
			<p>
				Begin by revealing cells that are surrounded by the fewest neighbors. These cells are
				usually safer to click on.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Use Clues Wisely</strong>
			<p>
				Pay close attention to the numbers revealed on the board. They provide essential information
				about mine locations. Analyze the patterns and use them to make educated guesses.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Flag Strategically</strong>
			<p>
				Flag cells you suspect might contain mines. This helps you keep track of potential hazards
				and prevents accidental clicks.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Stay Calm and Focused</strong>
			<p>
				3D Minesweeper can be challenging, but maintaining composure and focus will help you make
				better decisions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Practice, Practice, Practice</strong>
			<p>
				The more you play, the better your skills will become. Challenge yourself with different
				grid sizes and difficulties to improve your strategic thinking.
			</p>
